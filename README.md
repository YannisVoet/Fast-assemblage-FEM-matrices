List of main files:
experiment1: Numerical experiments designed to compare the performance of various assemblage algorithms for finite element matrices. Warning: this experiment might take a while.

experiment1_FF++: Assembles the same finite element matrices as in experiment1 using FreeFEM++

experiment2: Finite element simulation of a nonlinear transient heat transfer problem. Warning: this experiment might take a few minutes.

validation: Equivalent of experiment2 using MATLAB's PDE toolbox (the toolbox must be installed beforehand).
